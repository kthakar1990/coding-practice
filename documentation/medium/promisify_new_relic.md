## How to use Node Promisify with New Relic Synthetic monitors
Recently I came across a requirement where I had to use $http call on New Relic (NR) synthetic monitors and it uses node's request library to make the rest http calls.

However, NR does support the latest node promise handling features of async/awaitÂ . As per request's (documentation)[https://github.com/request/request#promises--asyncawait], in order to make the request to return promise there are several wrapper libraries. However, with node v8.0 there's also a support for util.promisify() which is totally awesome. So, I decided to use that and convert $http calls to return promise instead. This way I can use async function and await for the promises to resolve.
If you need to learn more information about util.promisify(), I recommend that your read more articles dedicated to that topic here.

Below is a example code snippet for Post request on NR:
```
const util = require('util');
const request = require('request');
let requestPromise = util.promisify(request);
const options = {
url: tiphost,
method: 'post',
json: true,
body: {
 foo: 'bar'
},
headers: {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
 }
};
let response = await requestPromise(options);
return response.body;
```

above example is for post request but it can easily be used for get request as well.

Hope this helps!

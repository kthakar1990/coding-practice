# Things to Review (Please keep this list clear or as shors as possible)
1. contiguous-sub-array.js has O(N^2) solution and there's a way to make it O(N) using stack (figure it out!)..




# Personal
- Complete your own solution first and then head over to LC discussion to figure out the most optimal solution
- In case your solution doesn't match up with most optimal solution - do an honest analysis on what went wrong
- Figure out how to come up with edge case, corner case and complex test case

# Getting Started with Algo/DS
- The Algorithm Design Manual - Skienna

# Comments
- 10 minutes, clarify assumptions, edge cases, define method. Define pattern:
- straight forward
- BFS / DFS
- Flood fill
- Brute Force
- Backtracking
- D.P
- Greedy
- 10 minutes come up with a brute force solution.
- 20 minutes, code
- 5 minutes, test

# Misc
- Focus just on L.C. Start with easy ones. Once I felt comfortable, go up to mediums and then hards.
- Go wide rather than deep. Don't focus on just one subject, but rather be varied.
- Focus on lists. Example "100 top interview questions", etc...
- Keep a record of time.

# Preparation worksheet KPIs to track progress

notes (did I nail it? why? why did I fail? what to look for?)
